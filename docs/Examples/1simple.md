```py title="main.py"
from fmov import Video
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

with Video("video.mp4", (1920//2, 1080//2), fps=120) as video: #(1)
    for i in range(video.seconds_to_frame(30)): #(2)
        img = Image.new("RGB", (video.width, video.height), "#000000") #(3)
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img) #(4)

        #          x    y                 content of the text                     color
        draw.text((100, video.height//2), f"Hello world! This is frame {str(i)}", fill="#ffffff")

        video.pipe(img) #(5)

    video.sound(path="./audio.wav", at="100", volume=0.5)

    video.sound(path="./audio.wav", at="4000ms")

    video.sound(path="./audio.wav", at="25s 500ms")
```

1. Creating the video via Context Manager. This video is a 1920 x 1080 video with a fps of 120fps. The video will be saved at './video.mp4'

2. This code loops through every frame that will make up a 30 second video

3. This creates the base image that we will draw on, the image is the same size as the video and will have a background color of black

4. This creates the draw context along with the image, which allows us to draw rectangles, text, etc.

5. This adds the frame to the video
